              <h1>What Will Our Game be?</h1>
              <br>
              <p class="fs-4">Our game, TurtleCove, will essentially be that of a play to earn MMOG featuring a wide variety of game modes. From <a href="">Dungeon crawler</a> to <a href="">Skirmish</a> and a lot more! <br> Players will for the most part be able to login with their metamask wallets on the Polygon Network, to then access their in-game accounts. <br> The vision of the game is to give players the opportunity to earn money that will be given out in $TRIBLING while having fun with friends and randoms! It also provides more use cases for our coin $TRIBLING for better long term The vision of the game is to give players the opportunity to earn money that will be given out in $TRIBLING while having fun with friends and randoms!
                 It also provides more use cases for our coin $TRIBLING for better long term support.  <br> <br> Accessibility is a key feature in the game. It'll be made so all players of TurtleCove have the opportunity to, with a minimal investment, make up to 1 day ROIs. More information is provided as you scroll throughout this page on how this can be achieved.
                  <br> Aside from that, TurtleCove will contain in game utilities that can be obtained through <a href=""> The Coral Reef </a> and the <a href="">Marketplace</a>. These gadgets can range from weapons and armor, to cosmetics, <a href="">souvenirs</a> and <a href="">boats</a>. These utilities however, don't necessarily provide competitive advantages, otherwise it would break the game. Instead it will bring forth greater potential rewards and more ways to earn from with the use of our <a href="">Ranking System.</a> <br>
                   We wish to build a sustainable game around the topic of the endangered turtles and sea life in general to spread awareness and provide support.     </p>

                <h1>What is Needed to Get Access to TurtleCove?</h1>
                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">Essentially, all holders of TurtleTribe NFTs will have access to the MMOG play to earn game.
                   They will be able to play a few of the basic game modes that we offer to start earning, typically paying an entrance fee that will vary between game modes and rankings. For TurtleTribe NFT holders who don't want to invest in gadgets, They'll be able to progress through the game regardless, but at a much slower and time consuming pace.
                  <br> For the people who missed the first drop of TurtleTribe NFTs, a second drop will be made at a given time that will be announced on our discord. However the new mint costs of the second drop will be relatively more expensive than the previous one. </p>

                <br>
                <p class="fs-4">Unreal Engine 4 will be the game engine we use, along with the Etherlinker plugin which for the most part allows Unreal Engine to interact with solidity smart contracts. With this approach, we will have the ability to link the game to the Ethereum Blockchain.
